  Qed.View — fine-grained reactive templates.

  A `View σ msg` is a *template*: a tree whose static parts are fixed and whose
  dynamic leaves are *projections* `σ → String` of a scope value `σ` (the model, or a
  row of a list). Unlike `view : Model → Html Msg` — re-run every frame, rebuilding
  the whole tree — a template is built once; on update only the projections re-run, so
  a value change costs O(bindings) and never walks the tree. That is fine-grained
  reactivity (SolidJS-style), but the value still lives in the model and `update` stays
  the pure `Model → Msg → Model`: the signal is *derived*, not a side channel.

  The meaning of a template is given by `render : View σ msg → σ → Html msg`, which
  evaluates it against a scope to produce an ordinary `Html`. So a template *is* its
  rendering — everything proven about `Html` (`diff_apply`) holds of `render t m`, and
  the simplest possible runtime is `view m := render t m` (the verified path, no
  fine-grained machinery). `Qed.Driver` then builds the DOM once and re-runs only the
  projections; `View.render` is the specification that fine-grained path is checked
  against (`Qed.ViewDiff`).

  Structure that *changes shape* — a conditional (`showIf`) or a keyed list
  (`keyedList`) — cannot be a projection, since a projection only changes a value, not
  the tree. Those reconcile through the existing verified `diff`: `showIf` renders an
  empty text node when false (so the slot is always present and positions stay stable),
  and `keyedList` renders a container whose children carry their derived `key`, exactly
  the keyed-reconcile shape `diff` already proves correct.

namespace Qed

/-- A template attribute: either a `stat`ic attribute (any `Attr`), or one `bind`ed to
    the scope (`σ → Attr msg`) — which covers both a dynamic value (`value="get σ"`) and
    a dynamic event whose message reads the scope (`onClick (.toggle row.id)` inside a
    list row, where `row` is only known per item). The driver re-evaluates `bind` attrs
    on update and leaves `stat` ones alone. -/
inductive VAttr (σ : Type) (msg : Type) where
  /-- A fixed attribute (reuse every `Attr` helper; a `Coe` wraps them silently). -/
  | stat (a : Attr msg)
  /-- A scope-bound attribute, recomputed from the scope when it changes (e.g. a
      scope-dependent event). The driver re-evaluates it on update. -/
  | bind (get : σ → Attr msg)
  /-- A dynamic *value* attribute `attr="get σ"`. Distinguished from `bind` so a list row
      can render it as a *signal* (`signalAttr`) — a value-only update sets it directly,
      no diff. In a scalar element it is just re-applied on update. -/
  | dynVal (attr : String) (get : σ → String)

/-- A fine-grained view template over a scope `σ`, producing messages `msg`.

    `text`/`element`/`static` are fixed structure; `dyn` is a value bound to the scope;
    `showIf`/`keyedList` are the two structural combinators (conditional, keyed list)
    that reconcile through the verified `diff` rather than as bindings. A `keyedList`'s
    `child` template is scoped to a *row* `α`, not the outer `σ` — its projections read
    the row — which is what makes per-row updates fine-grained. -/
inductive View (σ : Type) (msg : Type) where
  /-- Static text. -/
  | text (s : String)
  /-- Dynamic text bound to the scope: renders `get σ`, repatched when it changes. -/
  | dyn (get : σ → String)
  /-- An element: tag, template attributes, and template children. -/
  | element (tag : String) (attrs : List (VAttr σ msg)) (kids : List (View σ msg))
  /-- Conditional structure: render `child` when `cond σ`, else an empty text node
      (the slot stays present so sibling positions/bindings don't shift). -/
  | showIf (cond : σ → Bool) (child : View σ msg)
  /-- Two-branch conditional: render `yes` when `cond σ`, else `no`. A flip reconciles
      through the verified `diff` (the slot is replaced), exactly as `showIf` does; while
      `cond` holds steady the active branch value-patches in place. The lift target for a
      native `if c then a else b` in a view. -/
  | ifElse (cond : σ → Bool) (yes no : View σ msg)
  /-- A keyed list: a container `tag` whose rows are produced by the `forEach` combinator
      (which scopes each row's template to its own row type `α`, off this inductive — a
      nested `View α` field would be a non-uniform recursive occurrence the kernel
      rejects). The three driver-facing projections of the model are: `keys` (the row keys
      in order — cheap, drives the structural fast/slow decision), `sigs` (every row's
      dynamic values as `(signalName, value)` — the per-row *signals* that make a
      value-only update O(changed) with no diff and no `childAt`), and `rowsHtml` (the
      keyed `Html` rows, each dynamic leaf a `signalBind` node — used to build and, on a
      *shape* change, reconcile through the verified keyed `diff`). -/
  | keyedList (tag : String) (attrs : List (VAttr σ msg))
      (keys : σ → Array String) (sigs : σ → Array (String × String))
      (rowsHtml : σ → List (Html msg))
  /-- An escape hatch: drop a fully-formed `Html` subtree into a template (e.g. to reuse
      an existing component). It is opaque to the fine-grained path — always rebuilt. -/
  | static (html : Html msg)
  /-- The scope-bound escape hatch: an arbitrary `σ → Html` subtree. Unlike `static` it
      reads the scope, so it carries anything the fine-grained combinators can't express
      (a free-form `match`, a helper call). It is never value-patched — on every update it
      reconciles through the verified `diff` (`stable` is `false` for it), so it inherits
      `diff_apply`'s guarantee. The `view%` macro emits this for view code it can't
      decompose, making "lift what we can, diff the rest" the default. -/

/-! ### The value-patch path is a full re-render (verified)

The fine-grained driver, away from a `keyedList`, does not rebuild the tree: it walks the
template against the new scope and overwrites only the dynamic text/attributes in place.
`applyValues` is the pure model of that patch — start from the *old* rendered tree
(`render t s`) and reapply the dynamic parts at the new scope `s'`. `stable t s s'` is its
precondition, exactly the driver's value-only fast path: no `keyedList`, and no `showIf`
condition flips between `s` and `s'`. The theorem `applyValues_render` says that under
`stable`, the in-place patch reproduces a full re-render — so the non-list template path
inherits the same "the DOM equals the model's view" guarantee `diff_apply` gives the diff
path. (`keyedList` rows update through signals, outside `render`, so they are excluded.) -/

mutual
  /-- The driver's value-patch as a pure function of the old rendered tree: a `dyn` becomes
      its new text, an element re-evaluates its attributes and recurses, a non-flipping
      `showIf` recurses into the shown branch; everything else is left as built. -/

/-! ### Structural fingerprint for fine-grained list rows

A `forEach` row whose dynamic leaves are all signals updates in place via `setSignal`. But a
row part that `renderSig` bakes *statically* — an `ifElse`/`dynNode`/nested `keyedList`, or a
`showIf` flip — is invisible to the signal path, so a change there would be silently missed.
`collectShape` fingerprints exactly those parts; `forEach` folds the fingerprint into the row's
reconciliation key, so such a change becomes a *key* change and reconciles through the verified
keyed `diff` (`diffKeyed_apply`). Rows with no such parts (`hasOpaque` is `false`) keep the
plain key and the untouched signal fast-path. -/

/-! ### Row instrumentation for fine-grained lists

    A list row's dynamic leaves become *signals*: `collectDyn` lists a row template's
    `dyn` projections in pre-order (so each gets a stable index), and `renderSig` renders
    the row with each `dyn` as a `signalBind` node named `key#i` (its text pushed by the
    driver via `setSignal`, never through a diff). The two walk in the same pre-order, so
    index `i` names the same binding in both — that is what lets a value-only update set
    just the changed rows' signals with no `childAt` and no reconcile. -/

/-! ### `view%` — write a template like an ordinary view

`view% fun m => …` lets a fine-grained template read like an ordinary `Model → Html`
view: native control flow is lifted into the reactive combinators, so the dynamic parts
need no special syntax.

    view% fun m =>
      div [cls "page"] [
        h1 [] [text s!"Hello, {m.name}"],     -- interpolation → `dyn (fun m => …)`
        if m.count == 0                         -- a model-driven `if` → `ifElse`
          then p [] "nothing yet"
          else p [] [text s!"count is {m.count}"],
        forEach "ul" (·.todos) (·.id) row       -- lists stay explicit (need a key)
      ]

What it lifts:
* `text e` whose `e` mentions `m` → `dyn (fun m => e)` (also `s!"…{m.x}…"`).
* `if c then a else b` whose `c` mentions `m`, when a branch is a view → `ifElse`.

Anything else stays as written, so attributes (`dynAttr (·.f)`) and lists (`forEach`)
keep their explicit projections, and any subtree the macro can't decompose can be dropped
in verbatim with `dynNode (fun m => …)` (reconciled by the verified `diff`). -/
